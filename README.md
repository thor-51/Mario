PROBLEM STATEMENT

Welcome to CSI! As a new member, you'll be making many new friends. What's more fun than forming a really long conga line with a large group of friends? Your task is to replicate a simple 
2D game inspired by the classic Snake. You can use either JavaScript (with or without any frameworks) or Python (with modules like pygame, pyglet, etc). The game must have a player-controlled 
character that moves in all cardinal directions, a randomly spawning friend that can be recruited by the player, and an ever-expanding conga line.

Additional Features:
1. Player character: Create a player character controlled by the Keyboard that moves on a 2D canvas.
2. Player animations: Add all relevant walk and idle player animations.
3. Friend character: Randomly spawn a friend character within the 2D canvas.
4. Collisions (Friend): When the player meets the friend, the friend is added to the conga line and a new friend appears on a new location.
5. Conga line: Ensure that the conga line stays in order and the followers follow the player character.
6. Collisions (Follower): When the player hits a follower within the conga line, a Game Over message is displayed and the game stops.
7. Score: Display the score as the number of followers the player has collected.
